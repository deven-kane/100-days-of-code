### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 1: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Starting from the beginning with primitives and definitions.

**Thoughts:** Well, here I am again for the third time starting from the ground up. Each time I have given up or not really put in the effort; this time I hope that it'll be different. I really plan to work hard and make this into a career. I want to accomplish something in my life that isn't arbitrary. After watching Gary work so tirelessly and turn his life around for the better all I can think of is how I don't want to be left behind. 
I know this will be a tough journey and I'm finally ready. With that, heres to #100-days-of-coding and more.
